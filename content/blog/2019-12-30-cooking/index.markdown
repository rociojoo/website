I know what you are thinking: WTF. I know, but the truth is that when watching
masterchef contestants  -- UK season 10 in case you're wondering -- prepare
their dishes, I couldn't help but find parallels with scientific writing. So I
will write what I've learned about dishes and maybe you will, too, think about
them as papers and their components, or maybe not, maybe you will just think
about them as dishes and ingredients because cooking is great and food is
amazing. And there's nothing wrong with thinking about food!


## 1. Start with a plan

Plan your dish before you start. You must have a vision, an idea of what your
dish would look like in the end, what it would taste like, and with that in mind
you can plan the different steps to get there.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/plan.jpeg" alt="An open notebook. In one page, it reads meal plan for this week. Then a question mark. There's a pen on the notebook. " width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: It's better if you write your plan down.</p>
</div>

## 2. Remember that you have a finite and pre-defined amount of time

You have a deadline to deliver your dish, so your plan should be consistent with
the time given, and be very aware of the time during the whole process. This
could be a deadline to serve food to critics, or, in real life, to serve dinner
to your guests --which is your own deadline since you're the one who fixed the
time for dinner. Before the time is over, there has to be food on the plate.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/deadline.png" alt="The upper part of a clock. It's written deadline below 12 o' clock. And it's almost 12. " width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 2: Respect a deadline</p>
</div>


## 3. Choose a star of the dish

One element should be the star. And all of the others should work together to
enhance it. They cannot compete with each other for stardom.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/stevens_chicken.jpg" alt="Dish prepared at MasterChef UK. A juicy piece of chicken, with crunchy skin. Mushrooms, corn and greens. A yellow and a brown sauce. Beautifully plated. " width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Chicken is the star here. No doubt.</p>
</div>


## 4. Every element on the plate should have its own personality

Yes, there is a star. The star should shine not only with its own light, but
with the light of all the other elements on the plate. This requires each
element to be cooked in the best way possible to bring out all of its flavor and
looks.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/craigs_dessert2.jpg" alt="Dessert prepared at MasterChef UK. Deconstructed ice cream cone. Beautifully plated. " width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4: Can you imagine how tasty must be each element on the plate?</p>
</div>

## 5. Everything has to come together

Everything on the plate should make sense, so choose wisely. A dish should tell
one story, have one message. All elements should work as a team and complement
each other. And everything should be placed on the plate in a coherent way. If
you have elements that are perfectly cooked but should not be there, don't be
afraid to take them out if they are not working. They may be good for another
dish, not this one.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/fish_peas.jpeg" alt="Fish and chips at MasterChef UK. Battered fish pieces on one corner of the plate next to a piece of lime with cilantro. On the opposite corner, fried potatoes plated in a jenga style. The other two corners have cooked peas with tiny pieces of crunchy fish. Two sauces. " width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Fish and chips. Posh version.</p>
</div>

## 6. Make a good sauce that connects everything in the plate

In many cases -- maybe most cases, the dish is incomplete without a good sauce.
The sauce is sometimes mistakenly neglected, though it is the glue that sticks
everything together. It must have a perfect flavor, setting the tone of the
dish. And perfect amount. Too little and the elements will not be linked enough.
Too much and it will mask the elements you perfectly cooked.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/sauce.jpeg" alt="Shrimp and dark-green sparagus on a creamy marron bisque. MasterChef UK." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6: A creamy marron bisque does the job here.</p>
</div>

## 7. Execute everything as well as you can

Pay attention to the details from the moment you start cooking until you finish
plating. You've chosen a few elements that should be on the dish, so when you
cook them pay real attention. Don't serve them undercooked, and don't serve them
overcooked. Serve them perfectly cooked for the dish you're making. It is
possible to screw things up under high pressure, but try to avoid having
~~reviewers~~judges sending it back to the kitchen because they can't eat it.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/craigs_dessert.jpg" alt="Another great dessert from Craig (the previous dessert image was his too) at MasterChef UK. Ice cream in the foreground. Behind it, the thinnest slice of an apple as decoration, next to a donut. In the background, there seems to be one piece of caramel custard and a muffin. There's apple sauce. It looks like heaven. I'm hungry." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 7: Try to execute each element perfectly.</p>
</div>

## 8. Plating matters

Presentation is nothing without great cooking, nonetheless it should not be
disregarded. The presentation provides the first impression of your dish. The
look of the plate attracts people, it starts exciting them, almost preparing
them for your food. It is the first stage of the experience. Think about the
order in which each element is plated, and in which areas you need to pour more
sauce.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/octopus-desert.jpeg" alt="Creation at Central, a restaurant in Lima, Peru, and rated in the world's top-10. Beautifully plated pieces of octopus, with hedgehog and starfish, and a redish sauce" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 8: Octopus in the Desert. Central restaurant.</p>
</div>

## 9. Give an element of surprise

The same ingredients can be available to everybody. And chefs have had training
and experience, so they are not starting from zero or inventing the wheel; their
ideas may share similarities. There are going to be cooking techniques or parts
of the dishes that are known, common, expected. But be creative. Each product
can be cooked in many different ways. Make your dish a unique experience. Make
it bring a big unexpected hit of flavor. And worth going through the experience.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/beaufort.jpeg" alt="Beaufort cheese. But it doesn't look like it. It looks like a creamy white object with flowers, small leaves and walnuts on it." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 9: Beaufort, esprit d'un alpage. Jean Sulpice restaurant.</p>
</div>

## 10. Be true to yourself

Let your dish express who you are. 

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/picasso-dali.jpeg" alt="Drawing of Picasso and Dali painting next to each other. They are both painting the same egg, but in such unique styles that you would not think that it's the same thing." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 10: Let your work express your unique take on things.</p>
</div>


## 11. Work hard and take risks as you go

There is a lot of pressure. Try to cope with it without losing the joy in what
you're doing. Let that joy push you and increase your level. Challenge yourself.
Learn. Evolve. And, of course, there is a possibility that it won't work out.
The execution could be flawed. Or the idea. It may be the end of your dish but
not the end of the world.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/nitrogen.jpg" alt="A MasterChef contestant (can't remember which country) uses liquid nitrogen for her dish." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 11: Liquid nitrogen. That must be a challenge.</p>
</div>


## 12. Be a team player

There will be many times when you'll have to cook with other people. Play your
role whether if you're the chef or an assistant. Do your part. Cook for the
team. Cook with the team. Do your best so that you all make a beautiful and
delicious dish. And try to enjoy it.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/central_teamwork.jpeg" alt="Central restaurant in Lima, Peru. Chefs are plating in series. In the forefront, Virgilio, the owner of Central, participating of the plating process" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 12: Teamwork at Central.</p>
</div>


## 13. Be open to criticism

Try to use criticism to improve your cooking. And be ready for divided opinions.
Not everybody has to like everything in your dish, or like your idea. It's part
of taking risks. Also, if there comes a time when you have to be the critic,
remember you've been on the other side of the table.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/critics.png" alt="Three critics at MasterChef UK reviewing a dessert." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 13: Criticism can be hard, but try to use it to improve.</p>
</div>

## 14. Deal with failure

If in the end a dish doesn't turn out like you wanted, or gets bad reviews, take
a moment to try to fix it. If you can't, get up and cook again. Failure is part
of life.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/failure.jpeg" alt="Drawing of a man wearing a suit and using a bow and arrow. He is aiming at a target. On the floor, around 20 arrows, one for each time he missed the target." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 14: Failure happens. A lot.</p>
</div>

## 15. Remember that your food can be inspiring

It can make someone's day to have a very good meal. And a truly amazing dish
does not only make people happy; it's inspirational.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/virgilio-cushuro.jpeg" alt="Sorbet course at Central restaurant. Sweet lime, caigua ice, cushuro edible algae balls and edible clay. I actually tasted this one. A unique experience." width="50%" />
<p class="caption">Figure 15: Humid Green. Central restaurant. Sorbet course with sweet lime, caigua ice, cushuro edible algae balls and edible clay. For me, that's inspiring.</p>
</div>

## The end

If you managed to find all the parallels with scientific writing, you may think
that all of these lessons on scientific writing are really obvious. It may be
for many people. I just needed to watch masterchef to actually see them. And
I'll try to apply this to my research. It doesn't mean that it will work out,
but I'll do my best (number 14: deal with failure).

While reading this post, you could have found parallels with other tasks in
life. As a friend of mine said, "cooking is so universal that it'll teach you
lessons for the rest of your life". With respect to actual cooking, this is way
out of my league and I'm in no way trying to cook profesionally. It's still good
to have these things in mind, though. And it's been a great excuse to write a
blog post with pictures of amazing food.
