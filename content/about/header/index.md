  Hi! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Gracias por venir :)

I'm a data scientist at the [Research Team](https://globalfishingwatch.org/research/) 
of [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/). I'm Peruvian :peru:
and I currently live in Mexico :mexico:. Studies and work took my life to France
:fr: first and the US :us: later. The people I've met and the places I've visited 
have made me the person I am today. 

![Timeline. 2002-2007: B.S. Statistics at Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería, Peru.
2008: Bachelor intership and thesis. 2009-2010: M.S. Mathematics, Statistics and
Applications at Montpellier SupAgro and Université Montpellier 2, France. 
2010-2013: PhD Ecosystems / Quantitative ecology at Université Montpellier 2,
France. 2013: Postdoctoral associate at Institut de Recherche pour le 
Développement, France. 2014-2016: Research associate: Instituto del Mar del Perú.
2016-2017: Postdoctoral associate at IFREMER, France. 2018-2020: Postdoctoral
associate at University of Florida, USA. 2021: Data scientist at Global Fishing

Three things that define my work:

* **Movement**. That's my main research interest. Animal movement. Human
movement. Be able to identify patterns in trajectory data; implement and develop
tools to understand the drivers of movement. As a statistician, I am very much
interested in models and equations, but I'm also interested in the applications:
I want my research to be a contribution to the understanding of life. And to do
something meaningful. In my list of publications and presentations, you'll find
studies related to fishing vessel, seabird and raccoon movement, as well as more
general trajectometry studies. I also travel a lot. Way less with the pandemic. 

* **Team work**. I value collaboration in science and in life. I've learned to
work in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams, with ecologists,
fisheries scientists, oceanographers, engineers, data scientists, from different
countries and cultures. Every experience has been challenging and full of
rewards. Science is better when we work together.

* **Music**. I listen to music the whole day and consider myself a
drummer/percussionist in the making. I mute myself in calls because of my 
frequent and random taping and beatboxing.
